//Purpose: Actually just used to find mazes at the moment, so it's basically an empty component. Right now I'm storing the enum map used to generate the maze. 
//Really probably don't need to since I'm making full use of seed values now for maintainability's sake...hmmm...
//May make more use of this component in the future.
