So, I hate to say it, but we've all been thinking it: these text documents really don't cut the cheese. I would like to say I have the time and skill to create some high-quality PDFs for all of my assets but, unfortunately, I do not. What I have been able to do is create a series of tutorial videos on Maze Magician that will give you the rundown from top to bottom better than any poor text file ever could. The most up-to-date videos can be found on the asset store page for this product.

It's worth noting, for those of you who don't want to watch 40 minutes of video or whatever it is, that you can always just play around with this in Unity. Every single variable you can tweak in the inspector has tooltips (which I basiclly just copy and paste into my READMEs anyway) telling you what it's for and other useful information.
